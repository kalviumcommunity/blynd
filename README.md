url: https://blynd-dating.vercel.app/

## Problem Statement:

Online dating has become increasingly popular, but it comes with its own set of challenges. Through user research, we identified some common problems faced by users on existing dating apps. Many relationships formed online were perceived as casual, often ending in mere chats without a deeper connection. Additionally, users encountered instances where the person they met in real life differed significantly from their online persona.

To address these issues, we present Blynd—a unique dating approach that combines the suspense of blind dating with a thoughtful matching process, minimizing the risk of disappointment during in-person meetings.

## How Blynd Works:

1. **Account Creation:**
   - Users need to create an account by entering their information and uploading a profile picture.
   - They select the gender they are interested in.

2. **Profile Swiping:**
   - Users are presented with profiles that match their preferences.
   - Profiles can be swiped left or right based on interest.

3. **Matching Eligibility:**
   - To be eligible for a match, users must right swipe on more than one profile.

4. **Mystery Matches:**
   - When both users right swipe each other, a match occurs.
   - However, the users won't know with whom they matched until they meet in person.

5. **Setting Up a Date:**
   - Once there is a match, the female user is provided with a list of nearby places and available times for a date.
   - The male user then selects the final date location and time from the options chosen by the female user.

6. **Meeting in Person:**
   - The date is fixed, and users can only start chatting after meeting in person.
   - This approach encourages users to share their true selves, fostering more meaningful connections.

## Business Model:

Blynd takes a different approach from traditional dating apps. Instead of charging users, Blynd generates revenue through listing fees paid by cafes and restaurants that want to be featured in the list of nearby places for dating. This business model ensures that the app remains free for users while providing a unique and suspenseful dating experience.

Join Blynd and discover a new way to connect—where true personalities shine, and every match holds the promise of genuine connection.
