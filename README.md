The dating site name is: *Blynd*

Problem statement: 
There are online dating sites but through user research I came to know a few problems about online dating which people faced,
One was that the relationships made through online dating apps were very casual and most of them ended on chats as the users were not able to express their true personalities, 
And there were also cases when the matches even if they plan to meet in person after chatting for days and developing trust, when they meet the other person in real life, the person tends to feel very different from their expectations, it seemed to many people as if they chatted to a completely different person. 

So for solving these problems I came up with an idea for a new kind of dating approach, which has a suspense like blind dating, but also doesn't have the risk of you going on a date with a person who you don't want to go with.

How blynd works:
The user has to create an account by entering their info and uploading their picture and then select the gender they are interested in and according to that they will be shown profiles for swiping left and right.
The user can see the photos and info in the profiles. 
The users have to right swipe more than one profile then only they will be eligible for a match.

What happens when both users right swipe each other and there is a match?
This is where the blynd gets interesting, when there is a match both the users won't be able to know with whom they got the match, but the match will be from the one whom they have right swiped and you can't chat with your match until you meet them,
After there is a match the female user would be shown a list of nearby places and time for a date, from which she has to select, and then the male user will have to choose the final dating location and time from the options selected by the female user. Now the date is fixed and they can meet in person and share their true selves.

Business model?
Blynd won't be charging money from the users, unlike other dating apps. Instead it will be charging listing fees from cafes and restaurants to show it in the list of nearby places for dating.
